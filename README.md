# CV-to-all-positions-matching-system
In case of CV reception outside of a structured job posting (career fairs, networking invites etc.), the current coe utilizies machine learning frameworks in R to predict role suitability. 

MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS:
1) A specific path in your system where you store your downloaded CVs in pdf format
2) An excel sheet with at least the following columns: Position name, Department, Job Description, Job Requirements.

If executed, the output should inform the user of the 10 most appropriate positions for that CV/profile, the percentage of skill match (broken down to skill and topic match), the exact skills that match those needed and the skills missing for each skills category specified. 
There could be great opportunities of expanding the code, especially in terms of visualization, data exporting and utilizing historical data, as the current approach relies on machine learnong techniques that do not use past data, since my current company did not keep such repositories.
